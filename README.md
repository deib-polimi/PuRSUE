# PuRSUE
<b>PuRSUE</b> (From Specification of Robotic Environments to Synthesis of Controllers) is an approach that supports developers in the rigorous and systematic design of high-level run-time control strategies for robotic applications. The approach includes PuRSUE-ML a high-level  language that allows modelling the environment, the agents deployed therein, and their missions. PuRSUE is able to automatically check whether a controller that allows robots to achieve their missions might exist and, then, it synthesises a controller. 


### Organisation of the Repository
The repository is organised in different folders as follows:
- <i>Scenarios</i>: contains the scenarios considered in the evaluation
- <i>PuRSUE</i>: contains the PuRSUE components, installation instruction
